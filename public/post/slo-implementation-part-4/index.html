			<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited to be writing this blog post, as it is the final one in our
<a href="/post/slo-implementation-part-0">SLO Implementation</a> series.</p>

<p>In this final post, we&rsquo;ll discuss using Prometheus <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/">Alerting
Rules</a>
and <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/">Alertmanager</a> to notify
us when our blog is violating its SLO. Adding this alerting ensures
we will be aware of any severe issues our users may face, and allows us to
minimize the error budget spent by each incident.</p>
<h2 id="alerting-strategies">Alerting Strategies</h2>
<p>Our first step is deciding the algorithm we&rsquo;ll use to determine when we receive
an alert. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Workbook-Practical-Implement/dp/1492029505">The Site Reliability Workbook</a>
has useful guidance in this area. At the highest level, they state our goal &ldquo;is
to be notified for any <em>significant</em> event: an event that consumes a large
fraction of the error budget.&rdquo; They then define four categories by which we can
measure an alerting strategy: Precision (i.e. proportion of events detected that
were actually significant), Recall (i.e. proportion of actual significant events
detected), Detection time (i.e. how long it takes us to notify during a
significant event), and Reset time (i.e. how long after an issue is resolved
before the alert stops firing).</p>
<p>The workbook presents two main categories of alerting strategies. In the first,
we compare the current SLI measure to the SLO threshold, and alert when the
current measure is outside the threshold. We can tune both the timeframe over
which we calculate the &ldquo;current&rdquo; SLI measure (i.e. aggregate over 10m, aggregate
over 1d, etc.) and also how long we require the current SLI measure to be
outside the SLO threshold before we alert.</p>
<p>Another option is alerting on burn rate, which is &ldquo;how fast, relative to the
SLO, the service consumes the error budget.&rdquo; Again, there are a variety of
parameters you can tune when utilizing this strategy, such as alerting on
multiple different burn rates and also having multiple windows over which you
calculate burn rate. From my reading, this approach offers the best balance of
precision, recall, detection time, and reset time. However, it is decidedly
non-trivial to implement and reason about.</p>
<p>In the end, we have two options. We can take the simpler strategy to implement
and accept its shortcomings with respect to precision, recall, detection time,
and/or reset time, or we can take the more complex approach and accept the
difficulty of implementation and maintenance.</p>
<p>In the spirit of releasing MVPs, I chose the first option, and decided to alert
based on comparing the SLI measure to the SLO threshold. Specifically, we&rsquo;ll
receive an alert if our SLIs for availability and latency, as measured over the
last hour, are outside of the SLO threshold for more than 15 minutes.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Availability
sum(rate(caddy_http_response_status_count_total{service=&quot;blog&quot;,status!~&quot;5..&quot;}[1h])) / sum(rate(caddy_http_response_status_count_total{service=&quot;blog&quot;}[1h])) &lt; .99

# Latency
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(caddy_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{service=&quot;blog&quot;}[1h])) by (le)) &gt; 1
</code></pre><p>This alerting strategy has a fairly high precision, as if we are outside of the
SLO thresholds for &gt; 15 minutes, there is very likely an issue. Additionally, it
has a fairly good reset time, in that it takes at most an hour after an incident
is resolved for it to stop impacting alerting decisions. However, it does not
have great recall or detection time. Specifically, if we have a 100% outage, we
would still have to wait at least 15 minutes before receiving an alert, at which
point we could&rsquo;ve burned our entire error budget. Additionally, forcing the
SLI to be outside of the SLO threshold for 15 minutes introduces the risk of the
SLI oscillating around the threshold but never spending a full 15 minutes
outside of it. In this situation, we don&rsquo;t receive an alert even though there
may be a real issue.</p>
<p>Still, despite its flaws, I think our chosen alerting strategy will be
sufficient for an MVP. So let&rsquo;s move on to implementation!</p>

<h2 id="adding-prometheus-rules-for-our-alerting-strategy">Adding Prometheus Rules for our Alerting Strategy</h2>
<p>Prometheus supports
<a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/">AlertRules</a>,
which allow us to use Prometheus expression language to define an alert
condition, and send notifications about any firing alerts to an external
service.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator">CoreOS' Prometheus Operator</a>
provides the
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/alerting.md#alerting">PrometheusRule</a>
custom resource, which allows us to both specify a Prometheus alert rule. In the
file below, you can see we&rsquo;ve created three alert rules. The <code>BlogDown</code> alert
checks if the blog is not functioning at all, while the <code>SLOLatencyFailure</code> and
<code>SLOAvailabilityFailure</code> alerts utilize the previously discussed alerting
strategy to check if our blog is operating within its SLO.
I&rsquo;ve included the template file, with line by line documentation, below.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/e1d871db50d730048f4c7777e9719dfd.js"></script>
<p>We also must add a <code>ruleSelector</code> field to our Prometheus clusters' spec. This
<code>ruleSelector</code> field instructs our Prometheus cluster that it should alert on
any rules with label <code>role=alert-rules</code>. You can see the changed element of the
Prometheus manifest below. For now, ignore the <code>alerting</code> field, as we&rsquo;ll
examine it in the next section.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/be48cd708ef96f0ee25c8998b1e7c53e.js"></script>
<p>After applying both of these manifests to our Kubernetes cluster, our Prometheus
cluster will now regularly execute the queries defined in our alerting rules,
and raise an alert if necessary. If you navigate to the <code>/alerts</code> endpoint on
your Prometheus cluster UI, you should see the
image below. Please ignore the <code>DeadMansSwitch</code> alert, its just intended to
ensure that our alerting pipeline is working.</p>
<img src="/img/prometheus-alerts.png">
<p>Additionally, if you navigate to the <code>/rules</code> endpoint on your Prometheus
cluster, you&rsquo;ll receive in-depth information about your Prometheus cluster&rsquo;s
currently configured alert rules.</p>
<img src="/img/prometheus-rules.png">
<h2 id="deploying-alertmanager">Deploying Alertmanager</h2>
<p>Prometheus alerting rules are concerned simply with noticing something is wrong
and raising a simple alert. They are not intended to be responsible for
the more nuanced processing if processing raising alerts, such as routing them
to different channels (i.e. Slack, Opsgenie, etc.), grouping related alerts,
etc. <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/">Alertmanager</a> fulfills
said role within the Prometheus ecosystem, so our next goal is deploying
Alertmanager and configuring our Prometheus cluster to send all alerts to our
Alertmanager cluster, which will then process them appropriately.</p>
<p>For this specific example, we&rsquo;ll be configuring AlertManager to route all
critical alerts to <a href="https://www.opsgenie.com/">Opsgenie</a>, and to do nothing on
all non-critical alerts. For those who are curious,
I chose Opsgenie for the simple reason
that it offers a free tier and PagerDuty doesn&rsquo;t. For now, my alert escalation
policies are so simple that the functionality differences between the platforms
have no real impact. If you intend to exactly replicate the SLO implementation described
in this blog, you&rsquo;ll want to sign up for a free account with Opsgenie before
progressing to the later steps.</p>
<p>First, we need to create an <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/">Alertmanager configuration
file</a>, which we&rsquo;ll
eventually connect to the Alertmanager cluster running on Kubernetes.
At a high level, the file below directs Alertmanager to send all alerts with the
<code>severity=critical</code> label to Opsgenie and swallows all other alerts.</p>
<p>This configuration file ultimately must include our Opsgenie API key, which we
should treat as a secret and not check into source control. However, we still
want the remainder of the file in our Git repo, so we treat this configuration
file as a template file. We specify <code>opsgenie_api_key: ${OPSGENIE_API_KEY}</code> and
then use <code>envsubst</code> to fill in the template when necessary. We never save an
actual file with the <code>OPSGENIE_API_KEY</code> in source control.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">export OPSGENIE_API_KEY<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>...
cat alertmanager-config.yaml.sample | envsubst &gt; alertmanager-config.yaml
</code></pre></div><p>And here&rsquo;s the configuration file.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/ec5037865b0f0016ba85e7d6a8c290df.js"></script>
<p>We have our configuration defined, but we need a way to associate it with the
Alertmanager cluster which we&rsquo;ll be deploying. The Prometheus Operator
<a href="https://coreos.com/operators/prometheus/docs/latest/user-guides/alerting.html">documentation</a>
specifies that an Alertmanager resource will load its configuration from the
<code>alertmanager.yaml</code> data element in a
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Secret</a> titled
<code>alertmanager-$ALERTMANAGER_NAME</code>.</p>
<p>A Secret is a Kubernetes resource responsible
for storing a small amount of sensitive information. Pods with access to the
secret can then access the sensitive value either through exposing it as an
environment variable or mounting it as a volume into the container.</p>
<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-your-own-secrets">Multiple methods
exist</a> for creating secrets.
Ideally, we would prefer to check a manifest file for our Secret resource into
source control. However, as the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks">Kubernetes documentation
highlights</a>,
the base64 encoding of the sensitive information in the Secret manifest does not
provide any cryptographic security, and we must treat a Secret manifest file as
sensitive, and we definitely do not want to check sensitive information into source control.</p>
<p>We solve this problem similar to how we did with specifying the Opsgenie API key
in our Alertmanager configuration file. We create a <code>secret.yaml.sample</code> file,
which specifies <code>alertmanager.yaml: ${ALERTMANAGER_YAML_BASE64}</code> as its singular
data element. You can see the full file below.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/c54c3619c5b1fbb61fb7d985ea734e62.js"></script>
<p>We can then run the following sequence of commands to create the
actual <code>secret.yaml</code>, which we git ignore. We can keep the
<code>secret.yaml</code> on our local disk, meaning <code>kubectl apply -f templates/</code> still
applies manifests for all our Alertmanager resources. You only need to run the
below commands to regenerate the <code>secret.yaml</code> when Alertmanager configuration
changes, Opsgenie credentials change, or when you first clone the Git
repository.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">export OPSGENIE_API_KEY<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>...
export ALERTMANAGER_YAML_BASE64<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>cat alertmanager-config.yaml.sample | envsubst | base64 | tr -d <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;\n&#39;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>
cat secret.yaml.sample | envsubst &gt; secret.yaml
</code></pre></div><p>It&rsquo;s now smooth sailing for deploying Alertmanager, as our overall approach has
many parallels with deploying Prometheus to our Kubernetes cluster.
First, we create a simple
manifest for the Alertmanager custom resource, specifying we would like a
Alertmanager cluster with two replicas (i.e. high availability).</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/cf02ac21757bb1949ab15fb3c60f89c2.js"></script>
<p>Then, we create a service which allows us to access our Alertmanager cluster.
As we&rsquo;ve discussed in previous posts in this SLO implementation series,
I haven&rsquo;t yet configured
HTTPS for my services. As a result, we cannot do any form of meaningful
authentication, and as a result, I&rsquo;m hesitant to expose Alertmanager to the
public internet. So we ensure our service is not accessible externally, and then
use <code>kubectl port-forward svc/alertmanager 9093:9093</code> to form a secure
connection when necessary.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/794c7bea7387c56c9c1732cb8a389d1d.js"></script>
<p>Our final step is updating the <code>alerting.alertmanagers</code> value on our Prometheus
resource, to specify that our Prometheus cluster should send alerts to the
Alertmanager cluster we just created. The exact syntax necessary for updating
the manifest can be seen below.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/be48cd708ef96f0ee25c8998b1e7c53e.js"></script>
<p>And with that, Alertmanager should be good to go. See my
<a href="https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s/tree/master/applications/alertmanager">personal-k8s</a>
for every necessary manifest, as I continue to punt on describing RBAC in my
blog posts. We&rsquo;ll get to it soon, I promise.</p>
<p>After its up and running, and you&rsquo;ve run the port-forwarding command, you should
be able to navigate to <code>localhost:9093</code> and see Alertmanager (pictured below).
You also should start receiving alerts via Opsgenie whenever Prometheus fires an
alert..</p>

<p>Congrats, we made it to the end! Remember, in the <a href="/post/slo-implementation-part-0">first
post</a>, we said
&ldquo;our goal for this project is to create the monitoring infrastructure which will
allow us to monitor metrics pertaining to our SLO, and alert me when this blog
is violating its SLO.&rdquo; I think we accomplished all those objectives, and am
looking forward to how monitoring this blog&rsquo;s SLO will help me ensure it
provides a consistent level of service.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this series, and
please reach out in the comments if you have questions about any part of the
process. To be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure what the next Kubernetes
project I&rsquo;ll tackle is
(maybe trying to spend less money on my personal cluster&hellip;), but please stay
tuned because I&rsquo;ll definitely blog about whatever it ends up being.</p>
