			<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In <a href="/post/reducing-the-cost-of-running-a-personal-k8s-cluster-part-0/">my last blog
post</a>, I
introduced our goal of decreasing the cost of running a personal k8s cluster, and
made the case for why decreasing the cost is important. We also did some quick
calculations which showed that EC2 instances are the most expensive part of our
cluster, costing ~$115 per month or ~$1.4K per year. There&rsquo;s no time like the
present to actually start decreasing EC2 costs, so let&rsquo;s get down to business.</p>

<h2 id="optimizing-ec2-instances">Optimizing EC2 instances</h2>
<p>Again, using the default <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops">Kops</a> configuration,
the m3.medium we use for the master has 1 CPU and 4 GB of memory,
while the t2.mediums we use for the nodes combine to give us 4 CPU and 8GB memory.</p>
<p>We must first ensure our cluster actually needs all of these resources, as
the most blunt and effective cost-saving measure would be reducing the size of
our EC2 instances or, even better, deleting instances entirely. However, to
confidently undertake those actions, we must first show our cluster is
over-provisioned.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-resource-usage">Monitoring resource usage</h3>
<p>Previously, our cluster did not offer visibility into the resource usage of each
application running on the cluster, nor did it offer visibility into the
aggregate resource usage across all the applications running on the container.
Our first duty is giving ourselves this visibility.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with garnering micro insights into each application&rsquo;s resource
usage. By default, Kubernetes runs containers without any resource constraints,
meaning that, like a non-containerized process running directly on the physical
host, the processes in the container can attempt to claim all of the node&rsquo;s CPU and memory. The lack
of resource constraints is not a large problem when we have only one or two
applications running on our Kubernetes cluster. If we find our Kubernetes cluster low
on resources, we only have one or two potential culprits to investigate.
However, as soon as we start running a non-trivial number of
applications on our Kubernetes cluster,<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> it becomes much
more important to understand the minimum and maximum amount of resources
allocated to each container and have confidence Kubernetes will enforce said
limits.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Kubernetes provides
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container">first class support</a>
for containers specifying the minimum and maximum amount of
resources they require. Each container
can specify a <code>resource.request</code> and a <code>resource.limit</code> for both CPU and memory. A
pod calculates its resource request and resource limit by summing the resource
requests and limits for all its containers. A resource request is the minimum amount
of resources a pod needs to function. The Kubernetes scheduler will not schedule
a pod to a certain node unless the node can fulfill its resource request. The
limit is the maximum amount of resources a pod can consume. If the pod attempts
to use more CPU that its limit, it will be CPU throttled, and if it attempts to
use more memory than its limit, it will be terminated. For simplicities sake, we
define the limit and the request to be equal, essentially guaranteeing
each pod a given amount of resources. Setting them to the same value makes
determining the total resource needs of my cluster simple.</p>
<p>We can see an example of how to specify these values in the code snippet below.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: blog
        image: docker.io/mattjmcnaughton/blog
        ...
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: &quot;100m&quot;
            memory: &quot;100Mi&quot;
          limits:
            cpu: &quot;100m&quot;
            memory: &quot;100Mi&quot;
</code></pre><p>After ensuring all containers have a resource request/limit (see
<a href="https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s/commit/382be789d50f60a1a323cdf8a75fa53cbe213750">this commit</a>
for more details), we can trivially calculate the resources our cluster needs.
The master needs resources equal to the summation of all resource
requests/limits for all pods scheduled on the master, and the nodes need
resources equal to the summation of all resource requests/limits for all pods
scheduled on the nodes.</p>
<p>By allocating all of our pods a definite set of resources, we&rsquo;ve transformed our
original question of &ldquo;do we have an appropriate amount of resources for our
Kubernetes cluster&rdquo; into two simpler questions: &ldquo;is our cluster correctly provisioned
(i.e. is the sum of resources allocated to
each pod an appropriate percentage of the cluster&rsquo;s total resources)&rdquo;
and &ldquo;are our allocations of resources to pods accurate&rdquo;? We&rsquo;ll explore each of
these questions individually.</p>
<h3 id="is-our-cluster-correctly-provisioned">Is our cluster correctly provisioned?</h3>
<p>In order for our cluster to be &ldquo;correctly provisioned&rdquo; it should have an amount
of resources that is &ldquo;just right&rdquo;. As an example, we don&rsquo;t want to over-provision
(i.e. only use 10% of available resources), because then we are paying money for
computing power that we aren&rsquo;t using. Alternatively, we don&rsquo;t want to
under-provision (i.e. only be able to schedule 10% of our applications because
our cluster doesn&rsquo;t have the required resources). We want to be right in the
middle.</p>
<p>Once we ensure each of our pods has a resource request/limit, its easy to ensure
our cluster is not under-provisioned. Specifically, the scheduler will not
schedule a pod if it cannot fulfill its resource request. As long as all our
pods are scheduled, our cluster is not under-provisioned. We do not yet have any
auto-scaling, so the only time our cluster runs new Pods is when we add them.
Since pod creation is currently manual, I&rsquo;m comfortable with not having
automated alerts for whether were there are not sufficient resources to schedule
a pod. If we later add auto-scaling, or some other process wherein our cluster
would have a variable number of pods, we&rsquo;ll want to revisit this decision.</p>
<p>We can rely upon a equally lightweight manual method for determining if we&rsquo;ve
overallocated resources to our cluster. We can run
<code>kubectl describe node NODE_NAME | grep -A 5 &quot;Allocated&quot;</code> for details around
each node&rsquo;s resource allocation.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
Below we display a sample of the output for one of our nodes.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<img src="/img/node-describe-allocation.png">
<p>As you can see, we&rsquo;re fairly well provisioned. We&rsquo;re using ~70% of CPU, which is
just about where we want to be. We&rsquo;re only using ~40% of memory, which would
suggest that we should decrease our cluster&rsquo;s memory allocation while retaining
its CPU allocation. While that sounds like a good idea in theory, I don&rsquo;t
believe its possible with the currently available <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">EC2 instance
types</a>. The smallest compute optimized EC2
machine, the c5.large, offers our current allocation of two CPUs and 4 GB of memory
for slightly cheaper. While the c5.large is slightly cheaper than two
m3.mediums, we no longer have multiple nodes.
If we try the opposite strategy and try to get our four CPUs via running four t2.micros, which
would give us 4GB of memory instead of 8GB of memory, we&rsquo;d still be paying about
the same amount as we pay for two t2.mediums.</p>
<h3 id="are-our-allocations-of-resources-to-pods-accurate">Are our allocations of resources to pods accurate?</h3>
<p>Of course, all of the analysis we conducted in the previous section is worthless
if our per-pod resource allocation is incorrect. As such, we turn our attention
to whether we&rsquo;ve correctly allocated resources to our pods.</p>
<p>We answer these questions in two main ways. First, we can use <code>kubectl top pods</code>,<sup><a href="#fn4">3</a></sup> which gives us a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html">top</a>
style resource usage report. For example, the report shown below highlights that
our <code>prometheus-prometheus-0</code> pod is currently using 136Mi of the 500Mi of
memory allocated to our cluster.</p>
<p><img src="/img/kubectl-top-pod.png" /></p>
<p>While <code>kubectl top pods</code> is interesting, we&rsquo;re even more interested in seeing
resource usage as a percentage of resources allocated, particularly when it is
tracked over time. And if we can set up alerts for when we are in-danger of
under-provisioning our applications, that&rsquo;s also quite beneficial.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re guessing that we&rsquo;re going to use Prometheus, Grafana, and AlertManager
for to accomplish this monitoring and alerting, you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>We start by configuring Prometheus to scrape metrics from the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/">kubelet</a>,
which is the node agent responsible for managing the pods on the node.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/01fe7978db2cbf5106d3ac63763b5e2c.js"></script>
<p>Scraping Kubelet&rsquo;s exposed metrics gives us a couple interesting data points for
our desired monitoring.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>First, it defines <code>container_memory_working_set_bytes</code>
and <code>container_spec_memory_limit_bytes</code>, which are the memory the container is
using and the memory the container is allocated respectively. We can use the
query below to express the percentage of allocated memory the pod is utilizing.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sum(container_memory_working_set_bytes{container_name!~&quot;POD&quot;, pod_name!=&quot;&quot;, namespace!~&quot;kube-system&quot;}) by (pod_name) /
sum (container_spec_memory_limit_bytes{container_name!~&quot;POD&quot;,pod_name!=&quot;&quot;}) by (pod_name)
</code></pre><p>We graph this metric via Grafana, as can be seen below.</p>
<img src="/img/ratio-memory-limit-utilized.png">
<p>Kubelet also exposes helpful metrics for monitoring our pod&rsquo;s CPU allocation. We
are given the <code>container_cpu_cfs_throttled_seconds_total</code> metric, which we can
use to find how often a container was CPU throttled (i.e. under-provisioned
CPU), as seen in the expression below.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sum by(pod_name) (rate(container_cpu_cfs_throttled_seconds_total{container_name!~&quot;POD&quot;,namespace!~&quot;kube-system&quot;,pod_name!=&quot;&quot;}[1h]))
</code></pre><p>We again graph this metric via Grafana, as can be seen below.</p>
<img src="/img/ratio-time-cpu-throttled.png">
<p>Both these graphs are useful, but we don&rsquo;t want to be checking Grafana every day
to ensure our pod allocations are correct. Fortunately, we can use
Prometheus and AlertManager to add automated alerting for when pods are
under-allocated memory or CPU for a sustained amount of time. The
PrometheusRules we use for these alerts can be seen below.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/3ed9bc908d4d2c0c8325c79f80eefd06.js"></script>
<p>From our work above, we can be fairly confident we are not under-provisioning our
pods, and we know that if we do somehow start under-provisioning them, we&rsquo;ll
receive an alert. Its fair to ask whether we are over-provisioning our pods,
especially given the our fairly low memory usage. As I&rsquo;m relatively new to
managing pods on a Kubernetes cluster, I don&rsquo;t mind being slightly
over-provisioned for now, so I&rsquo;m going to leave our pod resource allocations.
However, its definitely something we should keep in the back of our minds.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-cost-of-the-needed-ec2-instances">Optimizing cost of the needed EC2 instances</h2>
<p>From our work above, we can be relatively confident that the 1 m3.medium
master and 2 t2.medium nodes currently backing our cluster are an appropriate
current resource allocation. We can now turn our interest to paying AWS as little as
possible for those machines.</p>
<p>Our largest savings come from experimenting with different AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">EC2 instance
classes</a>.
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/">on-demand</a> instance class AWS
utilizes by default. By default, AWS EC2 instances are of the
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/">on-demand</a> instance class. This
instance class prioritizes reliability and flexibility. We can start and stop
paying for an instance on a per hour basis, and AWS guarantees that the instance is
ours as long as we want it. However, reliability and flexibility have a price,
as on-demand instances are the most expensive instance class.
If we&rsquo;re willing to sacrifice either reliability or flexibility, we can pay less.</p>
<p>To sacrifice reliability, we utilize <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">spot instances</a>. Spot
instances are spare EC2 computing resources, for which Amazon allows you the set
a max bid. The spot instance price varies based on demand and capacity. If our
max bid is less than the market price, our instance will be terminated.</p>
<p>To sacrifice flexibility, we utilize <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/">reserved
instances</a>. Reserved
instances are a billing arrangement, in which Amazon gives us a discount on EC2
instances, on the pre-condition that we reserve the instance for a time period
greater than one year.</p>
<p>Each of these instance classes map to the different types of machines in
Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="reserved-instances">Reserved Instances</h3>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xUA7aLMq7BD17XsOeA" width="480"

href="https://giphy.com/gifs/seinfeld-hold-jerry-xUA7aLMq7BD17XsOeA">via
GIPHY</a></p>
<p>The master is a perfect candidate for a reserved instance. We
want the master to run constantly, and can also be fairly confident that
the resources required by the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/#kubernetes-control-plane">Kubernetes Control Plan</a>,
which is the predominant work load running on the master, will be
relatively consistent. If we are willing to commit to running our Kubernetes
cluster for ~1 year, and I am,<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>
then we can purchase a m3.medium EC2 Reserved
Instance for an entire year, and receive significant savings over the on-demand
price.</p>
<p>In AWS, a Reserved Instance is strictly a billing concept, meaning we don&rsquo;t need
to change anything with our Kops configuration. I purchased my m3.medium
Reserved Instance via the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/">AWS
UI</a>. I purchased it for
one year, and also chose a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/">Convertible</a>
Reserved Instance. The Convertible Reserved Instance allows us to essentially
&ldquo;swap&rdquo; our Reserved Instance for another Reserved Instance, provided that the
new Reserved Instance is more expensive. This swapping ability offers production
against our Kubernetes master needing more resources, in return for sacrificing
a small amount of savings.</p>
<p>Once we have purchased a Reserved Instance, we don&rsquo;t need to do anything.
Essentially, AWS looks at all the EC2 instances we have running, and if any
match unutilized Reserved Instances, we do not have to pay for them via the
on-demand billing mechanism. So we will keep the m3.medium master Kops
initially launched for us, and just start paying for it as a reserved instance.</p>
<p>From our calculations in <a href="/post/reducing-the-cost-of-a-personal-k8s-cluster-part-0">part 0</a>,
an m3.medium, payed for as an on-demand instance, costs $48.24 a month, or
$578.88 a year. I paid $406.00 for my m3.medium Convertible Reserved Instance,
With this simple change, I saved 30% on the cost of our master, and around 10%
our total cluster costs for the year.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="spot-instances">Spot Instances</h3>

GIPHY</a></p>
<p>While Reserved Instance&rsquo;s are a perfect match for Kubernetes' master, Spot
Instances are a perfect match for Kubernetes' nodes. Spot instances offer
significant savings, as long as we are comfortable with the idea that they might
be terminated in certain circumstances. Fortunately, we are comfortable with
that possibility, because one of Kubernetes' main benefits is its ability to abstract away
the details of the underlying hardware. An application running on Kubernetes
should have no concerns at all if an underlying node is terminated and replaced. Kops
itself supports this by managing all nodes via an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html">AWS Auto Scaling
Group</a>,
meaning that creating new nodes in response to old nodes being terminated is a
completely automated process.</p>
<p>Kops makes it trivial to start utilizing Spot Instances for your nodes.
As <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/instance_groups.md#converting-an-instance-group-to-use-spot-instances">Kops documentation</a>
explains, all we have to do is specify a <code>maxPrice</code> when configuring our
<code>InstanceGroup</code>, and Kops will launch Spot Instances instead of Reserved
Instances. We set our <code>maxPrice</code> as equal to the on-demand price of the instance
type.<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup>, although it is rare that we&rsquo;ll ever
actually need to pay that much.</p>
<p>As a quick but important aside, frustratingly, setting our max spot instance bid price equal to
the on-demand instance price does not guarantee that we&rsquo;ll always be able to
purchase Spot Instances. Some participants in the Spot Instance market set their
max price to a very high value (i.e. $1K) to ensure they will always win bids,
even when it would be cheaper to switch to on-demand instances for that brief
window. We are hesitant to adopt a similar tactic, because of its potential to
result in a surprisingly high AWS bill. However, this Spot Instance market quirk
does mean there will be short, infrequent windows (maybe once a week for 10 or so minutes)
in which we cannot purchase Spot Instances.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Such
downtime is a large problem for some applications and not so big a deal for
others. Ideally, we would use this issues impact on our applications' SLOs and
error budgets to determine the appropriate course of action.
Yet unfortunately for our current Kubernetes cluster configuration,
our monitoring/alerting runs on those nodes, so when we don&rsquo;t have
nodes, we have nothing to tell us when and to what extent our other services are
experiencing issues. Even with these drawbacks, we still believe the cost savings
of Spot Instances are worth it. Soon, we hope to fix this issue entirely by
purchasing a Reserved t2.medium instance, which we will use to ensure that at
least one pod is always running for our services with the most stringent uptime
requirements. If you&rsquo;re curious, you can follow along on <a href="https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s/issues/13">the
implementation</a> here,
and I&rsquo;ll of course blog about it when I&rsquo;m the work is complete.</p>
<p>The savings with Spot Instances are even more variable than the savings with
Reserved Instances, but again they are quite significant. On average, for the
us-west-1 region, a t2.medium spot instance costs around $.0139 an hour, compared to
$.0464 an hour for an on-demand instance. This reduces our yearly spend on our
Kubernetes' nodes from $801.79 to $240.19, for a savings of around 70%. Making
just this change would reduce our annual bill for our Kubernetes cluster by
around ~30%.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By verifying our Kubernetes cluster&rsquo;s needed computing resource allocation, and
determining the cheapest way possible to obtain said computing resources, we&rsquo;ve
reduced our annual bill from ~$2K to ~1.2K, for a overall savings of around
~40%! But we aren&rsquo;t done yet. We examined computing resources, but we still want
to examine storage resources (EBS volumes) and networking resources (ELBs).
We&rsquo;ll address these ideas in the remaining blog posts in this series. Looking forward to it!</p>
