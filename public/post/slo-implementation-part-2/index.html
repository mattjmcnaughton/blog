<p>In it, I&rsquo;ll be discussing deploying
<a href="https://prometheus.io">Prometheus</a>, the foundation of our planned monitoring
and alerting, to our Kubernetes cluster. This post will only discuss getting the
Prometheus cluster running on our Kubernetes cluster.
I&rsquo;ll leave setting up monitoring, alerting, and useful visualizations for a later blog post in the
series.</p>
<h2 id="deployment-strategy">Deployment Strategy</h2>
<p>The last application we deployed via Kubernetes, this blog, <a href="/post/hosting-static-blog-on-kubernetes">required us to
write the all aspects of the configuration from
scratch</a>. We could pursue the same
strategy when deploying Prometheus onto our Kubernetes cluster, defining from
scratch the needed Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets,
etc. However, doing so would be like writing my own web server to serve this
blog&rsquo;s static content. Sure we could probably do it, but it&rsquo;d be complicated,
and at the end of they day, we&rsquo;d have something worse than what already was
available in the open-source community.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d much rather utilize a method that&rsquo;s been developed and tested by the active
Cloud Native community. Not only does utilizing a community
method decrease the initial cost of deploying Prometheus, but it also decreases
the long-term maintenance cost, as I can rely on bug fixes and debugging
assistance from the community. Yay open source!</p>

<p>A couple of different community supported methods exist for deploying a
Prometheus cluster onto a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>The simplest option comes from the
folks at <a href="https://giantswarm.io/">Giant Swarm</a>. It&rsquo;s a collection of static
manifests one can use for deploying a <a href="https://github.com/giantswarm/kubernetes-prometheus">Prometheus
cluster</a>. Essentially, we
could clone their repo, run <code>kubectl apply -f manfiests-all.yaml</code> and we&rsquo;d be up
and running. However, we would only be able to manage our Prometheus cluster by
interacting with low-level Kubernetes API objects, such as Pods and Services,
with the manifest files. While we don&rsquo;t mind that method for small applications,
like this blog, it can become unwieldy with a more complex application like
Prometheus.</p>
<p>For a little more flexibility, we could use the
<a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus">Prometheus Helm Chart</a>.
I plan to discuss <a href="https://helm.sh">Helm</a> and Charts in
much greater depth in future blog posts, but at a high level, we can think of
them as a package manager for Kubernetes. Instead of directly interacting with
static manifest files and low-level Kubernetes API resources,
we define the Chart as a higher level abstraction. You
can template the helm chart with custom values and easily share them publicly.
Helm also offers tools for managing the deployment of charts, with both upgrades
and easy rollbacks. There are a ton of <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable">community contributed Helm
charts</a> for
installing popular applications, and fortunately, Prometheus is included.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the option of using <a href="https://coreos.com/operators">Operators</a>,
an exciting recent method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes
application. Similar to Helm Charts, Operators provide more application specific
resources with which we can interact. Operators are quite elegant in their
design and implementation, so I&rsquo;ll do a deep dive into how they work in the next
section. Spoiler alert, CoreOS has developed a fantastic
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator">Prometheus Operator</a>, and we&rsquo;ll
use it to deploy our Prometheus cluster.</p>
<h2 id="a-history-of-custom-resource-definitions-controllers-and-operators">A history of Custom Resource Definitions, Controllers, and Operators</h2>

GIPHY</a></p>
<h3 id="custom-resource-definitions">Custom Resource Definitions</h3>
<p>From the beginning, Kubernetes defined a number of lower-level resources (or objects), like Pods,
Services, ConfigMaps, etc. We could only perform CRUD operations on these objects.</p>
<p>Over time, users started wanting Kubernetes objects to be more high-level.
Instead of interacting with Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps, we wanted to
interact with applications. For example, we wanted to be able to run <code>kubectl get prometheus</code> and see all Prometheus clusters running on our Kubernetes
cluster just like we can run <code>kubectl get pods</code> and see all pods running on our
Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>Kubernetes supported this desire via
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">custom resource definitions</a>.
When we create a new CustomResourceDefinition object, we can then interact
with the API server to read/write information about our custom object. We can
achieve the above goal of running <code>kubectl get prometheus</code> and seeing all
running Prometheus clusters.</p>
<h3 id="controllers">Controllers</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve introduced a new custom object to the Kubernetes API.
However, we haven&rsquo;t explained how Kubernetes actually knows what actions to perform
when CRUD operations are performed on that API object. In other words, when we tell
Kubernetes to create or delete an instance of our Prometheus object, how is
Kubernetes to know what to do?</p>
<p>A brief look at Kubernetes architecture illuminates how we can make this
possible. Kubernetes runs an API server, to which the user could send requests, which will
read/write resources from/to Etcd&rsquo;s persistent storage.
It also contains the Control Plane, which is comprised of the
Controllers which are responsible for ensuring
the state declared in the persistent storage is reflected on the cluster.
In other words, if we send an request to
the Kubernetes API specifying there should be a Deployment containing
five pods running an Nginx container image, then the DeploymentController,
is responsible for ensuring said pods are actually running on some worker nodes.</p>
<p>We can follow the exact same pattern for the higher level object defined via the
CustomResourceDefinition. Specifically, we deploy our own custom Controller to
the Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for interacting with the Kubernetes
API and translating our CustomResourceDefinition into native Kubernetes
concepts. For example, if our Controller sees it must create a new Prometheus
cluster, it will use the Kubernetes API to create the appropriate Pods, Secrets, etc.</p>
<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
<p>An <a href="https://coreos.com/operators/">Operator</a> couples CustomResourceDefinitions
and Controllers with operational knowledge to allow us to deploy and manage an
application, at a high level of abstraction, entirely via the Kubernetes API.
Similar to a cloud provisioned service (i.e. Amazon&rsquo;s RDS), we can just specify
we want an application, and the operator will perform all the necessary actions
for it to exist.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-prometheus-operator-to-deploy-a-prometheus-cluster">Using the Prometheus Operator to deploy a Prometheus Cluster</h2>
<p>With a solid understanding of CustomResourceDefinitions, Controllers, and
Operators, we are ready to deploy our Prometheus cluster.</p>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l3vRdDji6VmVaj6kE" width="480" height="270"
frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a

GIPHY</a></p>
<p>Our first step is deploying the Prometheus Operator to our Kubernetes cluster.
We define templates for a couple different Kubernetes objects. Unsurprisingly
based on our previous discussion, we need to specify the
CustomResourceDefinition objects. We define a CustomResourceDefinition
object for each high level Prometheus concept, so we have CRDs for Prometheus,
PrometheusRule, ServiceMonitor, and AlertManager. We&rsquo;ll examine the code
for interacting with these CRDs shortly. We also specify a Deployment object
responsible for ensuring our custom Controller is running and translating our
CustomResourceDefinitions into the proper native Kubernetes objects.
Note, to keep this blog post focused, I&rsquo;m ignoring all RBAC-related manifests. I&rsquo;ll be diving
into RBAC in the future on this blog.</p>
<p>All manifests are available
<a href="https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s/tree/master/applications/prometheus-operator/templates">here</a>,
and running <code>kubectl apply -f applications/prometheus-operator/templates</code> after
cloning <a href="https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s">personal-k8s</a> will
actually deploy the operator to your cluster. These manifests are based on the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/master/bundle.yaml">recommended install
strategy</a>
from the good folks at CoreOS.</p>
<p>Now that we have the Prometheus Operator deployed, we can use it to create a
Prometheus cluster. We&rsquo;ll make use of the Prometheus and ServiceMonitor
CustomResourceDefinitions we created when deploying the operator, as well as
deploying a Service so we can access our Prometheus cluster.</p>
<p>We start with the manifest for our Prometheus custom resource. I&rsquo;ve written in-depth
comments in the script, but at the highest level, this manifest specifies we
want a Prometheus cluster with two replicas. This cluster should scrape metrics
from all ServiceMonitors which match the <code>app=blog</code> label.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/9e37613d51790db76fedbece10d28a32.js"></script>
<p>We progress to the manifest for our ServiceMonitor resource. A
ServiceMonitor specifies the services in Kubernetes from which our Prometheus
cluster should pull metrics. It is quite useful, as it means we don&rsquo;t have to write a
Prometheus config file, which can be
<a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config">non-trivial</a>
when trying to monitor an application running on Kubernetes. The embedded gist
provides line by line documentation, but overall this manifest specifies we will
monitor services matching the <code>app=blog</code> label.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/502eadd3ba655dc2a716041397fc99f1.js"></script>
<p>After applying the two manifests above, we should have a Prometheus cluster
running and scraping metrics from the services we specified. Our final step is
creating a Service to support us accessing our Prometheus cluster. For now, we
create a Service with the <code>ClusterIP</code> type, because we do not want to expose
this Prometheus cluster to the public internet as does not have authentication
or encryption. Fortunately, we can still access it via port forwarding.
If we run <code>kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090</code>, then the Prometheus
cluster UI will be accessible via <code>localhost:9090</code>.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mattjmcnaughton/80eed7fc04ff3c680463cfd2899ffe10.js"></script>
<p>Again, to keep this blog post focused, I&rsquo;m ignoring all RBAC-related manifests.
All manifests are available
<a href="https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s/tree/master/applications/prometheus/templates">here</a>,
and running <code>kubectl apply -f applications/prometheus/templates</code> after
cloning <a href="https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s">personal-k8s</a> will
actually deploy the Prometheus cluster to your k8s cluster. Once the cluster is
deployed, you can run the port forwarding command listed above to ensure you can
successfully connect. If you navigate to <code>localhost:9090/targets</code>, you should
see that your successfully scraping the <code>blog</code> endpoint.</p>

<p>Phew! We made it - thank you for sticking with me for this longer post.</p>

<p>In the next posts in this series, we&rsquo;ll focus on configuring a Grafana dashboard
to track our SLO/Error Budget indicators, and then in the following, and final,
post, we&rsquo;ll configure alerting around these indicators. Should be fun!</p>
