      <description>After a Saturday of disk partitioning, a trip to CVS for an emergency thumb drive, and much Googling, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post from a MacBook Air running Ubuntu 17.10.
I won&amp;rsquo;t write an entire tutorial on the installation, as some great ones already exist (in particular, I benefitted greatly from this tutorial from CalTech and this tutorial from Christopher Berner). Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll share why I installed Ubuntu 17.10 on my MacBook Air, some tips I found helpful during the installation, and the remaining shortcomings I hope to address in the coming weeks.</description>

      <description>Running ElasticSearch locally - its not so bad&amp;hellip; right? For such a powerful distributed system, running ElasticSearch locally is surprisingly doable. Assuming you already installed Java on your machine - and set up the appropriate apt repositories if you are on Debian - a simple [brew|apt-get] install will do the trick. Run elasticsearch with the appropriate configuration from the command line, and
curl http://localhost:9200/  should show your local instance is up and running.</description>
