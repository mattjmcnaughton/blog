# blog

Simple static homepage for myself.

Using sr.ht pages. See [sr.ht pages docs](https://srht.site/quickstart).

DNS is configured via Terraform in [this
repo](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/nuage/commit/bd8fef872102bce0c3386c7ad9fab92193464555).

My old blog is available via the `mattjmcnaughton/archive` branch, and at
