# Goals for my Kubernetes Cluster

- Each type of Kubernetes cluster has its own advantages and disadvantages.
  We need to know what we'll optimize for.
- Our preferences:
  - Initial set up should be painless
  - The right level of abstraction - give me the knobs, but put them at sensible
    values to start...
  - Don't cost too much
  - Be on AWS
