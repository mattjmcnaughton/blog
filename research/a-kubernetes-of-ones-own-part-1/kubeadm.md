# kubeadm

- kubeadm is a tool for bootstrapping a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster.
  - kubeadm does not manage any infrastructure for us. So if we want to use it,
    we will need another system for creating our physical master and worker
    machines.
  - Very interesting and doable tutorial:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/
  - Helped me understand more about Kubernetes internals, and would recommend
    that you go through it on a virtual machine.
  - However, a higher set up cost than I want.
