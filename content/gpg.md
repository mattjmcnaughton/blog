You can find my GPG public key [here](/mattjmcnaughton.pub.asc). I accept emails
encrypted using this public key and sign my emails with this public key when
helpful.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

<sup id="fn1">1. My email setup is a little bit in flux as I transition away
from Gmail to Fastmail and Mutt. I hope to post more about it soon, and
establish better guidelines for myself around when I GPG sign emails and when I
GPG encrypt emails.
