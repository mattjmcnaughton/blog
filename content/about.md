Hi, my name's Matt :) I live in NYC and am the proud parent of two pugs, Cosmo and Stuart!

I've worked at Flatiron Health since 2016 (my first job post-graduation from Williams College).
I was promoted to Principal Engineer in 2022, and currently focus on emerging AI technologies
and clinical research. Prior to joining Clinical Research, I focused on DevOps/DevEx solutions within our Evidence org.

From 2018-2020, I focused most of my "leisure" coding time on Kubernetes and the Cloud
Native ecosystem. I contributed code and reviews to
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) and
its associated projects as much as possible, and was tremendously excited and grateful to have
served as a [Reviewer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/269cd63e15031de6efed05f5d63d5403f7f010c4)
for sig-node. My biggest project was writing and implementing a
[KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) for [Building Kubelet Without
Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/20200205-build-kubelet-without-docker.md). Though I'm no longer working on Kubernetes every day, I still watch
the project with interest, and contribute when I can.

To be honest, as of 2025, I'm not the most prolific of bloggers,
but will post when I have something I'd like to share :)
