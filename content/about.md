Hi, my name's Matt. I'm a software engineer at Flatiron Health. In 2016, I graduated from Williams
College where I majored in computer science and political science.
I'm into systems programming and developer tooling (especially Kubernetes and Cloud Native),
open-source, baking bread, and mental health advocacy. You can find me on
[Github](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton) or through [email](mailto:mattjmcnaughton@gmail.com).
