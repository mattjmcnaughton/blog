Hi, my name's Matt :) I live in New Jersey (after 10 years in NYC) and am the proud parent of two pugs, Cosmo and Stuart!

As of December 2025, I'm working to re-engineer Clinical Research for impact as a Principal Software Engineer at Paradigm Health.
Previously, I worked at Flatiron Health from 2016-2025.

For the last couple of years, at both Paradigm Health and Flatiron Health, I've focused on emerging AI technologies and clinical research.
In my early days at Flatiron, I focused on DevOps/DevEx solutions within our Real World Evidence business.

From 2018-2020, I focused most of my "leisure" coding time on Kubernetes and the Cloud
Native ecosystem. I contributed code and reviews to
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) and
its associated projects as much as possible, and was tremendously excited and grateful to have
served as a [Reviewer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/269cd63e15031de6efed05f5d63d5403f7f010c4)
for sig-node. My biggest project was writing and implementing a
[KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) for [Building Kubelet Without
Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/20200205-build-kubelet-without-docker.md). Though I'm no longer working on Kubernetes every day, I still watch
the project with interest, and contribute when I can.

To be honest, as of 2025, I'm not the most prolific of bloggers,
but will post when I have something I'd like to share :)
