Hi, my name's Matt :)

I work as a SWE at Flatiron Health. I graduated from Williams
College where I majored in computer science and political science.

Currently, I focus most of my leisure coding time on Kubernetes and the Cloud
Native ecosystem. I contribute to [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) and
its associated projects as much as possible, and am tremendously excited to have
recently been added to the [Kubernetes Github Organization](https://github.com/kubernetes)
and made a [Reviewer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/269cd63e15031de6efed05f5d63d5403f7f010c4)
for sig-node.

I also run [my own personal Kubernetes](http://mattjmcnaughton.com/post/a-kubernetes-of-ones-own-part-0/)
cluster, on which I host this blog and other applications.
See [this repo](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s)
for the most recent information on work I've done and work I hope to do in the
future on my personal cluster, as well as all the code :)

All my k8s work started in my senior year of college (2015-2016), when I wrote a
[thesis](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/thesis) entitled "Predictive
Auto-scaling of Pods in the Kubernetes Container Cluster Manager."

In the past, I spent a couple of months in the summer of 2017 developing
[Sheepdoge](https://github.com/sheepdoge), which is essentially [Boxen](https://github.com/boxen)
but for Ansible. I also contributed to [elasticsearch-dsl-py](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py).

More broadly, I'm into open-source systems programming and developer tooling,
tinkering with Linux on the desktop, Toronto sports teams, baking bread, and mental health advocacy.
