Hi, my name's Matt :)

I work as a SWE at Flatiron Health. I graduated from Williams
College where I majored in computer science and political science.

To be honest, as of 2020, I'm not the most prolific of bloggers,
but will post when I have something I'd like to share :)

I like open-source systems programming and developer tooling,
tinkering with Linux on the desktop, reading, Toronto sports teams, baking bread,
and participating in mental health advocacy. My post on [Programming w/
OCD](/post/programming-with-ocd/) remains my favorite :)

From 2018-2020, I focused most of my "leisure" coding time on Kubernetes and the Cloud
Native ecosystem. I contributed code and reviews to
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) and
its associated projects as much as possible, and was tremendously excited and grateful to have
served as a [Reviewer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/269cd63e15031de6efed05f5d63d5403f7f010c4)
for sig-node. My biggest project was writing and implementing a
[KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) for [Building Kubelet Without
Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/20200205-build-kubelet-without-docker.md). Though I'm no longer working on Kubernetes every day, I still watch
the project with interest, and contribute when I can :)

In the past, I also ran [my own personal Kubernetes](http://mattjmcnaughton.com/post/a-kubernetes-of-ones-own-part-0/)
cluster, on which I hosted this blog and other applications.
See [this repo](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s)
for the code. See [my latest self-hosting
project](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/nuage) for how I'm currently hosting
this blog.

All my k8s work started in my senior year of college (2015-2016), when I wrote a
[thesis](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/thesis) entitled "Predictive
Auto-scaling of Pods in the Kubernetes Container Cluster Manager."

In a non-k8s vein, I spent a couple of months in the summer of 2017 developing
[Sheepdoge](https://github.com/sheepdoge), which is essentially [Boxen](https://github.com/boxen)
but for Ansible. I still use [Sheepdoge](https://github.com/sheepdoge) to manage my machines,
although active development has slowed :)
I also contributed to [elasticsearch-dsl-py](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py).
