Hi my name's Matt! I'm a software engineer at Flatiron Health. In 2016, I graduated from Williams
College where I majored in computer science and political science. I'm into distributed systems, open-source, cooking, and
mental health advocacy! You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton) or
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/@mattjmcnaughton) or through
[email](mailto:mattjmcnaughton@gmail.com).
