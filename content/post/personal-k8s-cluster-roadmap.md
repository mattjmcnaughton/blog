## The Problem

So far, my ideas for experimenting with my [personal Kubernetes
cluster](/post/a-kubernetes-of-ones-own-part-0/) have been
spread out across discrete blog posts. As a result, its difficult for me, and I
imagine y'all as the readers, to track a prioritized list of projects.

I also think that, in the future, it will be useful for us to be able to easily see
which projects have been completed and which have not. Particularly as I plan to
accompany all projects with blog posts, having a discoverable enumeration of my
personal cluster's features will give readers an easy way to know on which
subjects they can expect guidance.

## The Solution

I've centralized all of my Kubernetes related code and configuration in the
[personal-k8s](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s) repo.

I'll use
[Github issues](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s/issues)
to aggregate planned work and
[Github projects](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/personal-k8s/1)
to prioritize the backlog, and track in progress work.

I'm hoping this will provide a bit of organization to an undertaking for which I
have a whole bunch of ideas I'm excited about!

P.S. I apologize for the interruption from the [SLO
Implementation](http://mattjmcnaughton.com/post/slo-implementation-part-0/) series.
I promise my next blog post will be on deploying Prometheus to a Kubernetes
cluster :)

P.P.S There are additional reasons why I centralized all of my Kubernetes
configuration and code in a single repo, but I'll explore those in a different
blog post.
