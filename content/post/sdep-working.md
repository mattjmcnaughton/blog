Just a short post to announce that
[sdep](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/sdep), the tool I wrote for deploying
static websites to S3, is working! Check out the
[travis.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattjmcnaughton/blog/master/.travis.yml) for
this blog to see how it can be used to easily continuously deploy a blog.

Certainly a lot of steps to go, but exciting to have a working version!
