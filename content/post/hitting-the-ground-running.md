I've had the pleasure of working at [Flatiron Health](https://www.flatiron.com/)
since August 2016. Some of the biggest lessons I've learned have related to
participating in effective code reviews. I wrote up some of my learnings in a
[blog post](http://flatiron.engineering/culture/2016/10/25/hitting-the-ground-running.html)
for [Flatiron's Engineering Blog](http://flatiron.engineering/). Hope you enjoy
(and check out some of the other great content written by other Flatiron
engineers on the blog)!
