Hiya folks, just a quick post from me today :)

After over a year of daily(-ish) contributions, I just want to let folks know
I'm going to be taking a step back from contributing to Kubernetes. Once [this
diff](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94953) is merged, I won't be
a reviewer for sig-node anymore. Additionally, with
the [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements)
for [Building Kubelet Without Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/20200205-build-kubelet-without-docker.md)
complete, my major projects are all wrapped up, and I doubt I'll be
picking up new ones.

At the end of the day, contributing to Kubernetes is something I
do in my free time, and I just can't keep up contributing at the
same daily cadence and still devote time to other non-programming areas
of my life in the way I want. I don't want to short-change sig-node by
failing to do the daily work to keep up with diffs, proposals, etc.
I'll of course continue watching Kubernetes with interest,
and I'm tremendously grateful to all the sig-node folks who mentored me.

Since the majority of this blog's content resulted from my Kubernetes' contributions
and experiments, and I'm trying to spend more of my free-time doing non-computer things,
my posting frequency here will also slow. I'll still keep this blog up
so that folks can view the backlog, and also because I may have thoughts I'd
enjoy sharing in the future. But I won't pretend that I'm going to post with any type
of regular cadence :)

As always, you can reach me through [email](mailto:me@mattjmcnaughton.com).
You can find my GPG public key [here](/mattjmcnaughton.pub.asc).
Please don't hesitate to reach out if I can ever be of any help, particularly if
it relates to mental health and programming or diversity and inclusion in
tech/open source.
