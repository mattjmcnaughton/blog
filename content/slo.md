For more context on why this blog has an SLO, please read my [blog post](/post/this-blog-has-an-slo).

## SLO

- The proportion of successful requests, as measured from nginx logs and where any status
  code other than 5XX is considered successful, is > 99%.
- The proportion of sufficiently fast requests, as measured from nginx logs and
  where sufficiently fast is defined as < 1s, is > 99%.

## Error Budget

Coming soon.

## Metrics and Dashboards

Coming soon.
